The Miscs aren’t as important and should be done throughout the 1st semester like homework. If you want to get more resources (or have some) for qualifiers (as a Zeus you should) or are
just ahead, then text me directly @doqca on https://www.instagram.com/doqca/!
I really recommend looking over the scripts as they’re like all of the other resources wrapped up nice and neatly which can be found in the resources directory!

Also recommend learning how to run scripts from a GitHub repo if you don’t know how to currently: https://projectdestroyer.com/2018/01/run-scripts-github/. 
For the final section, you’ll almost always be running a bash script or python script which is done using the bash or python3/pip3 commands followed by the script name respectively. 

Have a fun time hacking or whateva :)

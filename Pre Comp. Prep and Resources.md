Super good resource that (if you’re on Zeus, you should use - if not, go away :)):

These are the CIS benchmarks for ALL image types. I recommend you study them extensively to get the most out of them. They are pretty long for during-round view. I’m serious, this resource is an almighty resource that includes things that CP often scores for too. Use it wisely. Again I recommend not using it in round cause it’s long, and if you make finals, you won’t be able to use anything not made by the team.

Miscellaneous resources:
-

- HackTheBox: Good way to get into more hacking (academy has slight paywall, but initial courses are free so try them out:
  - https://academy.hackthebox.com (Academy - If you're a little new to linux)
  - https://www.hackthebox.eu (Actual site - If you're fairly confident in your Linux and hacking skills)
- Hacking (Also a great book for getting into more hacking (Not necessarily for Linux or Debian)
- Prizes and information to motivate you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberPatriot


The Miscs aren’t as important and should be done throughout the 1st semester like homework. If you want to get more resources (or have some) for qualifiers (as a Zeus you should) or are
just ahead, then text me directly @doqca on https://www.instagram.com/doqca/!
I really recommend looking over the scripts as they’re like all of the other resources wrapped up nice and neatly which can be found in the resources directory!

Also recommend learning how to run scripts from a GitHub repo if you don’t know how to currently: https://projectdestroyer.com/2018/01/run-scripts-github/. 
For the final section, you’ll almost always be running a bash script or python script which is done using the bash or python3/pip3 commands followed by the script name respectively. 

Have a fun time hacking or whateva :)

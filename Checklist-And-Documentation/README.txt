This is the documentation from previous rounds. It contains the steps used to score points in each round along with any commmands.

The "Field Checklist" is one page checklist. It should be used a guide to set a gameplan for the start of the round.
It contains very broad recommendations and does not go into specifics.
For more specific issues, a more in depth checklist should be used.
But if all you need is a something to help you out when you are out of ideas, the Field Checklist should be used. 
Please keep the Field Checklist to one page maximum.

Feel free to update the Checklist or add any documentation after each round. 
I will update any of these shortly after the round.
